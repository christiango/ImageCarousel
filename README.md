## Getting Started

The use of this app requires an API key with flickr. This API key is not stored in the repository, so you must provide your own key to use this app. In order to do this, create a file called apiKey.js at the root of the repo and it should have contents looking something like this:

```javascript
export const FlickrApiKey = 'MYAPIKEY';
```
